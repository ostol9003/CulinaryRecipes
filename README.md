# Culinary Recipes App 

## Overview

Culinary Recipes is a comprehensive mobile application developed as part of the "Design of Mobile Business Applications" course. This project features an API and a front-end built using Xamarin, designed to provide users with an engaging and user-friendly platform for managing and exploring culinary recipes.

## API

The backend API for the Culinary Recipes app handles various functionalities, including user authentication, recipe management, and data storage. It provides endpoints for:

- User registration and login
- Adding, editing, and deleting recipes
- Viewing recipe details
- Searching for recipes based on different criteria (e.g., ingredients, cuisine, difficulty level)

## Front-End (Xamarin)

The front-end of the application is developed using Xamarin, a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications. The Xamarin-based interface ensures a smooth and consistent user experience across both iOS and Android devices.

## Functionalities

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system to manage user accounts.
- **Recipe Management**: Users can add new recipes, edit existing ones, and delete recipes they no longer need.
- **Recipe Exploration**: Browse through a vast collection of recipes, view detailed instructions, and ingredient lists.
- **Search and Filter**: Powerful search functionality to find recipes based on various criteria, including ingredients, cuisine type, and difficulty level.
- **Favorites**: Users can mark recipes as favorites for easy access in the future.
- **User Profiles**: Personalized user profiles where users can manage their information and view their contributed recipes.

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages:
- C# (for both backend and front-end development)
- SQL (for database management)
- JavaScript (for any additional scripting requirements)

### Frameworks:
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Core for building the API
- **Front-End**: Xamarin.Forms for building cross-platform mobile interfaces

### Database:
- SQL Server for data storage and management

### Development Tools:
- Visual Studio for development and debugging
- Postman for API testing

### Other Technologies:
- RESTful API principles for designing the API endpoints
- MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern for the Xamarin front-end
- JSON for data interchange between the front-end and the backend
